Between June and August 2026, at least four Czech regional hospital groups went to market separately for what is structurally the same thing: an interoperability layer that lets hospital systems talk to each other and to outside providers [S1,S3]. Uherské Hradiště awarded ~€7.7M for an eHealth communication platform [S1]; the Plzeňský kraj hospital group has an open ~€5.8M tender for NIS delivery with ESB and integrations [S2]; Zlín's KNTB awarded ~€2.8M for a NIS with integration scope [S3]; FN Olomouc bought interoperability work [S3].

Why now: the European Health Data Space regulation (in force since March 2025, with obligations phasing toward 2029+) makes structured, exchangeable health records a legal end-state [S7], and Czech hospitals are spending toward it now, hospital by hospital [S4], without a shared platform. The procurement cluster is the evidence: this is recurring, multi-buyer public spend on an unsolved integration problem.

Who pays: hospital groups and kraje (the owners) — today via SI tenders, which is exactly the opportunity for consultancies and dev shops; longer-term, a productized interop/ESB layer with Czech NIS integrations (Stapro FONS/TransMISE, ICZ eMEDOCS) [S8] could compress these €0.7-7.7M projects into licensing deals [S1,S2,S3].

Existing non-solutions: the incumbent Czech NIS vendors (Stapro, ICZ, CompuGroup) sell systems and their own integration stacks [S7,S8]; per NKÚ's January 2026 digitalization report, the national layer hospitals are waiting for is six years late, with health-data sharing and eZádanka slipping from 2020 to 2026-at-the-earliest and legally required registries still missing [S6]. Each hospital tender therefore re-solves interoperability locally, and what the registr smluv shows about how that goes is not flattering: STAPRO service amendments repricing upward, works deadlines extended, and one integration-platform contract on its eighth amendment [S5].

## Revisions

2026-08-13 · de-rank — A gap check found real CZ integration products (Medicalc mEx, PHYSTER, Stapro FONS/TransMISE, ICZ eMEDOCS, AutoCont ESB ACIB), so the original "no product layer" framing was too strong [S8]; gap stays 0 with incumbents named and status moves to watching. What survives the check: EHDS conformity deadlines (2029/2031) now put a dated end-state behind the spend [S7], and the NKÚ receipt plus the amendment churn document that the current model is failing its buyers [S5,S6]. Watch the Plzeň open tender outcome and the EHDS implementing acts (Mar 2027) for the moment this re-ranks [S2,S7].

2026-08-20 · evidence audit — Four unbacked claims removed. NCEZ: the institution and the claim that it "sets standards but ships no tooling" both return no hits anywhere in the signal corpus or in any source note here. "StaproMedea" (a mangled compound) and "AMIS" appear nowhere in the register at all; the product names that are on file sit in this record's own gap-check note, so the clause now reads Stapro FONS/TransMISE and ICZ eMEDOCS and is cited to [S8] rather than to three TED tenders that name none of them. "Each is a bespoke SI project; none produces a reusable product" — the tender receipts show what was bought, not what the delivery produced. And "the products are mostly incumbent-ecosystem stacks rather than neutral layers" — the gap check names the products but does not characterise their architecture.

2026-08-24 · fact check — The "€3-8M projects" range misdescribed its own receipts: the awards on this ledger are ~€7.7M, ~€5.8M, ~€2.8M and ~€0.7M [S1,S2,S3], so two of the four fall outside it. Body and build note now state the receipted span, €0.7-7.7M. The three TED values were re-verified live against the TED API on this date — 189.2M, 143.0M and 68.8M CZK — and the registr-smluv lookup corpus independently pairs STAPRO and ICZ.HEA with named hospital buyers, corroborating the incumbent picture [S5,S8].
